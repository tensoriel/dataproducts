========================================================
 A Poisson distribution is the probability distribution that results from a Poisson experiment, which is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:

- The experiment results in outcomes that can be classified as successes or failures.
- The average number of successes (Î¼) that occurs in a specified region is known.
- The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
- The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.
- The specified region could take many forms. For instance, it could be a length, an area, a volume, a period of time, etc.


The ui.R file
=================
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(eeptools)
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  
  # Title
  headerPanel("Visualizing the Poisson Distribution"),
  
  sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput("obs","Number of observations:",
                min=0,max=1000,value=100),
    sliderInput("lambda","vector of non-negative means:",
                min=1,max=20,value=5)
    
    ),
  
  # GGPLOT
  
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput("distPlot")
  )
  
))
```

The server.R file
======================
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)

shinyServer(function(input,output){
  
  output$distPlot<-reactivePlot(function(){
    
    dist<-rpois(input$obs, input$lambda)
    
    p<-qplot(dist,binwidth=0.02)+geom_vline
    (xintercept=mean(dist))+theme_dpi()
    
    p<-p+coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-5,30))
    +geom_vline(xintercept=median(dist),
                color=I("red"))
    
    print(p)
  })
  
  
})

```


Using the App
========================================================
Specifiy the following using slider bars & dropdown box:
- The number of observations
- The value of the non-negative mean of the Poisson distribution
